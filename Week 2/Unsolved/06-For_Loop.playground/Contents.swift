/*
 Control Flow - For Loop
*/

// For loop for print the index each time (5)

/* use underline to replace the index if the index is not referred
 print("I am studying iOS in 2021") 3 times
 */

/* iterate a range with fixed internal
 for example: 0,5,10,..20
 Use the stride(from:to:by:) function to skip the unwanted marks.
 */


/* iterate over an array
 names = ["Hua", "Jack", "Hasan", "Firas"]
 print: Hello + name
 */


/* iterate a string and print each character
 print "ABCDEFG"
*/

/* iterate a dictionary, and print the keys and values
 dicts = ["FEIT": 1, "Business": 2, "Law": 3, "Medical": 4]
 */

/* For loop combines with if to control the process
 iterate from 1 to 10, and break when equal to 5
